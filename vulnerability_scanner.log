My reasoning is that the query "Display the first 3 records" implies interaction with the uploaded CSV file, specifically the vulnerability-related records. The query is requesting a specific subset of data, which is a characteristic of data-related operations. According to the guidelines, this type of query is routed to "pandasaiAgent".
