Conversation-with-your-vulnerability-scans by using LLMs 

Project: Having a meaningful conversation with your scan reports generated by various tools like SAST tools checkmarx, SYNK etc. 

Utilizing ChatGPT for analysis raises security concerns. This tool leverages open-source LLMs to bring vulnerability scanning analysis into natural language. Instead of relying on technical jargon, this tool, powered by LLMs such as LLaMA2 (and GPT can be used too), communicates in clear and understandable language.

The packages used -streamlit -streamlit-pills -pandasai -langchain_groq -langchain_community

The main tool's goal is the use of LLM capability for security.

Note: For automated query generation:

# Check if we need to generate new smart queries
current_file_name = uploaded_file.name
if (st.session_state.smart_queries is None or 
    st.session_state.current_file_name != current_file_name):
    
    with st.spinner("ðŸ§  Analyzing your data to suggest relevant queries..."):
        st.session_state.smart_queries = self.generate_smart_queries(self.df)
        st.session_state.current_file_name = current_file_name

# Interactive elements
question_selected = st_pills.pills(
    "âœ¨ AI-Generated Queries Based on Your Data",
    st.session_state.smart_queries or self.config.ui.DEFAULT_QUESTIONS,
    [""] * len(st.session_state.smart_queries or self.config.ui.DEFAULT_QUESTIONS),
    index=st.session_state.pill_index
)
